1.  SimpleDecoder reduce 3m params in ResUnet 
    and 8m params in Unet with Resnet50 as backbone

2. All experiments (Resnet backbone, ResUnet) with structure loss converges at value 0.044

TODO: 
1. Add Augmentations
2. Add Resnet layer as bridge
3. Test SASA as backbone
4. Run experiments with train_size 352      # Running with Resnet backbone
5. Try with larger batchsize
