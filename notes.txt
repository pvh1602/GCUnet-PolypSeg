1.  SimpleDecoder reduce 3m params in ResUnet 
    and 8m params in Unet with Resnet50 as backbone

2. All experiments (Resnet backbone, ResUnet) with structure loss converges at value 0.044

TODO: 
1. Add Augmentations                # Added 
2. Add Resnet layer as bridge       # Added but can not run because of torch.__version__ = 1.6 in laptop can not load pretrained (Need pytorch 1.8)
3. Test SASA as backbone
4. Run experiments with train_size 352      # Running with Resnet backbone 
5. Try with larger batchsize


##### 18/04/2021
1.  Ran experiments with train_size 352 with Resnet18 and Resnet34 (Resnet50 n_blocks=1, stop at epoch 8)
2.  Resnet50 bridge has ~ 15m params while Resnet34 and Resnet18 have 13m and 8.4m params respectively.
3.  Added Augmentations
4.  Write Summary_Result file
